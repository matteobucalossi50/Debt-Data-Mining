# Debt-data-analysis
Analyzing debt data using machine learning models.

# BREIF DESCRIPTION:
Analyzed mortgage and debt data to determine how an individual is affected by debt given their classification and uncover any disparities between groups.

Performed data pre-processing to eliminate outliers and replaced missing values.

Conducted feature selection to find the most important features.

Further analysis was done using the KNN, SVM and Logistic Regression, the three methods were then ensembled.

# DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES:
- real_estate_db.csv: Dataset used for analysis.
- graph.py: Contains codes for visualisation of the data.
- .png/.pdf: Generated from the "graph.py" file. (All the graphs are also uploaded, so that "graphs.py" does not need to be run again)
- gui.py: Generates GUI where KNN, SVM ,Logistic Regression and ensembing are demonstrated.
